# Change Email

{:toc}


## Introduction

Changing email is done in 3 steps, the user's email will not be chaged until all 3 are completed:

1. [Request a change](#request-change-step-1)
2. [Confirm the change from the old email address](#confirm-change-step-2)
3. [Verify the new email](#verify-new-email-step-3)

To find out what state of change the user's email is in you can use the user's new_email and is_new_email_confirmed attributes
as follows:

* If `new_email` is an empty string, the user is not trying to change their email.
* If `new_email` is non-empty and `is_new_email_confirmed` is false, the user has completed step 1 and needs to click the link in the email.
* If `new_email` is non-empty and `is_new_email_confirmed` is true, the user has completed step 2 and needs to click the link in the email.


## Request Change (Step 1)

**Authentication Required**

This begins the process of changing an email.  Once this step is completed a confirmation email will be sent
to the user's **old** email with a link to `<frontend>/change-email/<token>`.  The token will be used in the next step and
expires after 24 hours.

    POST /todo/change-email/

### Input

Name | Type | Description
---- | ---- | -----------
`new_email` | `string` | The email to change to.


## Confirm Change (Step 2)

**Authentication IS NOT required**

The second step is confirming that the user has control over the original email.  Once this step is completed
an email will be sent to the user's **new** email with a link to `<frontend>/change-email-verify/<token>`.  The token
will be used in the last step and expires after 24 hours.  After this `user.is_new_email_confirmed` will be `true`.

    POST /todo/change-email/confirm/

### Input

Name | Type | Description
---- | ---- | -----------
`token` | `string` | Token from the URL in the email sent in step 1.


## Verify New Email (Step 3)

**Authentication IS NOT required**

The last step is verifying that the user has control over the new email.  Once this step is completed the user's
email will be change and they will no longer be able to use the old email to login.

    POST /todo/change-email/verify/

Name | Type | Description
---- | ---- | -----------
`token` | `string` | Token from the URL in the email sent in step 2.


## Resend Confirmation Email

**Authentication Required**

If for some reason the user does not receive the confirmation email (sent in step 1) they can have it resent.

    POST /todo/change-email/resend/


## Resend Verification Email

**Authentication Required**

If for some reason the user does not receive the verification email (sent in step 2) they can have it resent.

    POST /todo/change-email/verify-resend/


## Cancel Change

**Authentication Required**

If at any time during the change email process the user decides that they don't want
to change their email, they can cancel it.
