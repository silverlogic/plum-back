# Validation Errors

If a request receives an invalid request body it will result in a `400 Bad Request` response.  The
response body will be the validation errors.  A validation error is an object.  The key is the
field that failed and the value is an array of error messages.  If an error is not specific to one field
it will be under the `non_field_errors` key.

~~~
HTTP/1.1 400 Bad Request

{
  "non_field_errors": ["You are not cool enough."],
  "email": ["That email is already in use."]
}
~~~

If the validation error occured on a nested object
the key will be the nested object name and the value will be a validation error.

        "non_field_errors": ["You are not cool enough."],
